################################################################################
From version 0.3 the extension will use GSettings from GIO instead of using
extra values from metadata.json. Therefore, a proper schema file for gsettings
is needed.
Please refer INSTALL. If the schema file isn't installed properly, the extension
WILL BE CRUSHED and then, whole gnome shell.
