# This extension is gnome shell extension. However, this extension uses
# gsettings, so some more steps are needed.
#
# 1. Install extension
# Put the extension in extension folder.
# If you want install this for all users (globally), change latter path into
# /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

cp -R nexus@wsidre.egloos.com/ ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

# 2. Install gsettings schema
# Proper schema file is needed to be installed properly.

sudo cp schemas/org.gnome.shell.extensions.nexus.gschema.xml \
	/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

# After you put the schema file, compile schema files.

sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

# If you are smart, you would find this file can be executed and will install
# the extension. And you may want to run below code.
# $ chmod +x INSTALL ; sh INSTALL
